# Project Proposal Overview

## Details

Team Name: Team Jacob

Team Members:

- Owen Kemp
- Jehoshua Tayo-Ayorinde
- Chris Nodel
- Jacob Colley

## Synopsis

The outcome should be a restaurant ordering system, where customers/waiters can place orders, and the program will show whether the order is being made, and notify when it is completed (and some unspecified additional features like food reviews). It will have a graphical interface that makes it easy for the user to see the menu, place orders, and monitor progress. This project would be good learning for us because we will learn about the full stack experience that may be used for jobs. It would be good for us if we succeed because it will help restaurants manager ordering (even though said systems exist).
