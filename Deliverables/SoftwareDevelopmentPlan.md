# Software Development Plan

## Administrivia

Meetings: Agenda for the week, Evaluation of the previous week. 20 minutes

## Development Methodology

Agile: Meet at least once a week online through Discord.

Each sprint will have:

- Coding and Testing
- Meeting to review and make an agenda for next.

We will communicate through a Discord server to allow for fast communication.

## Responsibilities

Everyone has a responsibility to make sure others are doing their work and check Discord at least once a day.

Anyone who gets done with their section should try to connect their section to others (Database to Server, Server to GUIs). After, they should try to help others.

## Process to Develop

Complete the Software Development Plan and Requirements over 2/10 to 2/11 and polish it until the deadline.  Work on Design specification until the 2/22.  Work on Minimum Viable Product and complete it for 3/8.  Then do alternating weeks of adding new content and testing until the finish of the project.

## Milestones

- Important Milestones that some combine the development methodology with constraints you cannot change (e.g., how long the course is).

  - 2/14 Software Development Plan
  - 2/15 Minimum Viable Product Requirements
  - 2/22 Design Specification
  - 3/8 Minimum Viable Product
  - 4/4 Finish of Project
