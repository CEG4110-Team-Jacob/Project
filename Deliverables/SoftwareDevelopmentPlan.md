# Software Development Plan

## Administrivia

Meetings: Agenda for the week, Evaluation of the previous week. 20 minutes

## Development Methodology

Agile: Meet at least once a week online through Discord.

Each sprint will have:

- Coding and Testing
- Meeting to review and make an agenda for next.

We will communicate through a Discord server to allow for fast communication.

## Responsibilities

Everyone has a responsibility to make sure others are doing their work and check Discord at least once a day.

Anyone who gets done with their section should try to connect their section to others (Database to Server, Server to GUIs). After, they should try to help others.
